if the distance threshold has been reached on a scroll up.   |\n\n## Behavior\n\nBy default, the directive listens to the **window scroll** event and invoked the callback.  \n**To trigger the callback when the actual element is scrolled**, these settings should be configured:\n\n- [scrollWindow]=\"false\"\n- set an explict css \"height\" value to the element\n\n## DEMO\n\n[Try the Demo in StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngx-infinite-scroll)\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst, import the InfiniteScrollModule to your module:\n\n```typescript\nimport { NgModule } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { BrowserModule } from \"@angular/platform-browser\";\nimport { InfiniteScrollModule } from \"ngx-infinite-scroll\";\nimport { platformBrowserDynamic } from \"@angular/platform-browser-dynamic\";\nimport { AppComponent } from \"./app\";\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [BrowserModule, InfiniteScrollModule],\n  declarations: [AppComponent],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);\n```\n\nIn this example, the **onScroll** callback will be invoked when the window is scrolled down:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Component } from \"@angular/core\";\n\n@Component({\n  selector: \"app\",\n  template: `\n    <div\n      class=\"search-results\"\n      infiniteScroll\n      [infiniteScrollDistance]=\"2\"\n      [infiniteScrollThrottle]=\"50\"\n      (scrolled)=\"onScroll()\"\n    ></div>\n  `,\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  onScroll() {\n    console.log(\"scrolled!!\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\nin this example, whenever the \"search-results\" is scrolled, the callback will be invoked:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Component } from \"@angular/core\";\n\n@Component({\n  selector: \"app\",\n  styles: [\n    `\n      .search-results {\n        height: 20rem;\n        overflow: scroll;\n      }\n    `,\n  ],\n  template: `\n    <div\n      class=\"search-results\"\n      infiniteScroll\n      [infiniteScrollDistance]=\"2\"\n      [infiniteScrollThrottle]=\"50\"\n      (scrolled)=\"onScroll()\"\n      [scrollWindow]=\"false\"\n    ></div>\n  `,\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  onScroll() {\n    console.log(\"scrolled!!\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the **onScrollDown** callback will be invoked when the window is scrolled down and the **onScrollUp** callback will be invoked when the window is scrolled up:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Component } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { InfiniteScroll } from \"ngx-infinite-scroll\";\n\n@Component({\n  selector: \"app\",\n  directives: [InfiniteScroll],\n  template: `\n    <div\n      class=\"search-results\"\n      infiniteScroll\n      [infiniteScrollDistance]=\"2\"\n      [infiniteScrollUpDistance]=\"1.5\"\n      [infiniteScrollThrottle]=\"50\"\n      (scrolled)=\"onScrollDown()\"\n      (scrolledUp)=\"onScrollUp()\"\n    ></div>\n  `,\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  onScrollDown() {\n    console.log(\"scrolled down!!\");\n  }\n\n  onScrollUp() {\n    console.log(\"scrolled up!!\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the **infiniteScrollContainer** attribute is used to point directive to the scrollable container using a css selector. **fromRoot** is used to determine whether the scroll container has to be searched within the whole document (`[fromRoot]=\"true\"`) or just inside the **infiniteScroll** directive (`[fromRoot]=\"false\"`, default option).\n\n```typescript\nimport { Component } from \"@angular/core\";\n\n@Component({\n  selector: \"app\",\n  styles: [\n    `\n      .main-panel {\n        height: 100px;\n        overflow-y: scroll;\n      }\n    `,\n  ],\n  template: `\n    <div class=\"main-panel\">\n      <div\n        infiniteScroll\n        [infiniteScrollDistance]=\"2\"\n        [infiniteScrollThrottle]=\"50\"\n        [infiniteScrollContainer]=\"selector\"\n        [fromRoot]=\"true\"\n        (scrolled)=\"onScroll()\"\n      ></div>\n    </div>\n  `,\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  selector: string = \".main-panel\";\n\n  onScroll() {\n    console.log(\"scrolled!!\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt is also possible to use **infiniteScrollContainer** without additional variable by using single quotes inside double quotes:\n\n```\n[infiniteScrollContainer]=\"'.main-panel'\"\n```\n\n# Showcase Examples\n\n- [Echoes Player - Developed with Angular, angular-cli and ngrx](http://orizens.github.io/echoes-player)
